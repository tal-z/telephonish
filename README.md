# Telephonish

Telephonish is a modern twist on the classic game of Telephone, where players whisper a phrase or sentence from person to person and see how it changes by the end. With Telephonish, your whispers are replaced with new ways of getting the message across. You can play online with your friends, no matter where they are in the world!
